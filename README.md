# Moments
This repository contains scripts for 3D and 4D demographic models using the program Moments
## Purpose
Perform demographic model optimization and comparisons with the python package [moments](https://bitbucket.org/simongravel/moments/src/master/). This repository contains demographic models for three and four populations SFS.
## Overview
In the main repoitory there are two scripts (moments_Run_Optimizations.py & Optimize_Function.py) that must be in the same directory to run properly. These scripts were developed by [Dr. Daniel Portik](https://github.com/dportik/moments_pipeline) and have been modified for our purposes. The optimization script will perform the optimization routine proposed by [Portik et al., 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.14266). The routine was originally written for [dadi](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000695) but will also work for moments.
